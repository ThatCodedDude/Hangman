# Hangman
This is a hangman game I programmed in C. This is my first self-made github repository, and for anyone browsing, I hope you enjoy! Although, to be honest, it probably has alot of bugs that I might fix one day. 
#How to Run Hangman
In order to run the game, you will need a C compiler, and will have to be on a windows operating system (Preferably Windows 10 or 11). When compiling, be sure to compile every file, including the header files.
